# RokuApp
Python script for Roku with UI and keyboard controls. Optionally can also include a Spotify controller (I added this so playing music on Chromecast didn't require using Spotify app to flip back and forth)

Known bug: currently basically forces you to also use the spotify remote due to the spotify_auth code being global
Lots of spotify behavior not implemented
Planning to have spotify buttons change icons dynamically based on play state
